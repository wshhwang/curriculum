**Real-life scenario:**

Say, there is a company called BitTool that specializes in hardware production. BitTool focuses on producing  kindergarden materials and repairing tools for professional workers. BitTool recently recieved business orders from the Happy Kindergraden and an electrician.

In a few days, BitTool produced many simple tools of similar functionalities, so the company wants to pack these materials based on their shapes, types, or common purposes. BitTool prepared multiple boxes and each of them contains many materials with different sizes but similar functionality. This is a real-life example of using the **list** to group different elements together **based on their similarity**.

In the following week, BitTool finsihed a set of professional toolkit for the electrician. Each tool in the kit is unique for a special application at work. Ultimately, Bit-tool made a set of toolkit that label each tool with a description, so the electrician can select a tool and look up the instruction before her work. Therefore, we can use the **dictionary** to distinguish each tool as a **unique type matching to a instruction manual**.



In this lab, we will be boxing and unboxing with **object-oriented programming**. 

**Overview:**

We will write an **abstract** class `Box`, and, from it, inherit two classes `BitBox` and `BitKit`.  Afterwards, we will write a function,  `repack_boxes`, which takes any number of boxes as parameters, gathers up all the items they contain, and redistributes them as evenly as possible over all the boxes. 



You should end up with two boxes with 11 items each, and one box with 12 items.

Now let us learn how to do this step by step!

### **Abstract class Box**

Let's start with writing an "abstract" class `Box`.

Write an “abstract” class, `Box`, and use it to define some methods which any box object should have: `add`, for adding any number of items to the box, `empty`, for taking all the items out of the box and returning them as a list, and `count`, for counting the items which are currently in the box.
