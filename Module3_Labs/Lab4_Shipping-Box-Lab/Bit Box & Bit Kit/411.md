To take out all the items in the boxes, we can define the first part of our program such as this:

```python
def repack_boxes(*boxes):
        items = []
        for box in boxes:
            items.extend(box.empty())
```

In this program, we run a for loop for all the boxes we have, empty them out one by one, and add the items that we take out of the boxes into a list.

Now we have three empty boxes and a list of all the `Item` objects.
