Define `add` function such as this:

```python
def add(self, items):
```

In this function, we take in a list of items as parameters, then we check whether or not this item is already in the dictionary. 

We can do it by:

```python
for i in items:
    if i.name in self._items: 
```

IF the `key` (item's name, `i.name` in this case) does not exist, then we store the `Item` object and count of item as values to the entry. We can put them together by storing them in a list.

```python
self._items[i.name]= [i, 1] 
```

IF the `key` exist, then we increase the count of the item by one:

```python
amount =  self._items[i.name][1]
self._items[i.name] = [i, amount+1]
```
