Define `BitKit` such as this:

```python
class BitKit(Box):
```

So that the program would know that it inherits from class `Box`, and would have the following methods: `add`, `empty`, `count`.

Define the `__init__` function such as this:

```python
 def __init__(self):
        self._items = {}
```

So that an empty dictionary of items are created, when we instantiate a `BitKit`.
