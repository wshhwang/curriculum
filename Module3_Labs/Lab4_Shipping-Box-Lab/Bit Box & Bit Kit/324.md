Definite `count` such as this:

Retrieve a list of all the values in the item dictionary by:

```python
items = self._items.values()
```

Now `items` should contain a list of `Item` Object and count of the item.  (Such as this: [ `Item`, count of the `Item`])

Note that instead of extract a pure list of all the `Item` object,  we want to extract all the count of the items, which is stored in the second variable. If we can sum up all the second variables of the items in the list `items`, we can get the total number of items in the box.

```python
sum(item[1] for item in items)
```
