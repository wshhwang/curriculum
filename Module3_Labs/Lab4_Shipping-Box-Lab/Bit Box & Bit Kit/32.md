Let's consider how to build  `class BitKit` here.

First , let's define `BitKit` as an implementation of our abstract class `Box`, just like `BitBox`.

Then, initiate a variable in class, ` _items`, that stores all items in the box in our `__init__` function. However, instead of using a list, we use dictionary. The `key` should be the `name` of the `Item` object, and the `value` should contain both the object, `Item`, and the number of  that item that is stored in that box.

Now, write an `add` function that takes in an array of items, and add them to our dictionary. Write an `empty` function that return all of our items in a list, and empty our dictionary. Write a  `count` function, that counts the number of items which are currently in the box.
