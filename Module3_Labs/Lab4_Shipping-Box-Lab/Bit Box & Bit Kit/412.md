Now that we have a list of `item`. We can distribute it evenly, like how we deal cards. By first giving an item to Box1, then Box2, then Box3, and repeat until all the items are gone. Put that into code:

While the list `items` is not empty,  run a for loop to add one item at a time into each box. 

```python
while items:
    for box in boxes:
        try:
           item = [items.pop()]
            box.add(item)
```

When the items are emptied, but the for loop is still running, `items.pop()` will yield an `IndexError`. 

```python
while items:
    for box in boxes:
        try:
            item = [items.pop()]
            box.add(item)
        except IndexError:
```

Catch that error and break out of the for loop.

```python
while items:
    for box in boxes:
        try:
            item = [items.pop()]
            box.add(item)
        except IndexError:
        	break
```
